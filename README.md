# GitHub Game Off

the theme for [2017's GitHub Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017) jam is **throwback** - so I'm throwing all the way back to before I was born and trying to make something for the NES

I'm aiming to make a little time-trial-ish racing game, mostly inspired by the RC car minigame in Super Mario Odyssey

this project is my first time touching any kind of assembly and any console development so it's bound to be bad, messy and a lot of fun

build.bat refers to [NESASM3](http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/NESASM3.zip) ([which is open source!](http://www.nespowerpak.com/nesasm/nesasmsrc.zip)) to assemble it to a .nes

## x-nes

to play this on the itch.io page I'm using the wonderful [x-nes](https://github.com/koenkivits/x-nes) JavaScript emulator
